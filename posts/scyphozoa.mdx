Drifting through this crushing abyss,

a purgatory born from my own descent.

My screams sound for thousands of miles,

but nothing ever answers.

For even echoes suffocate in this void

<br></br>

There are few glimpses of light down here,

yet they are often chthonic in nature,

their beauty a lure to the lost.

Get too close,

and they'll drown you in their agony. 

<br></br>

So please release me from the jaws of your memory,

and let me sink back down, deeper than before.

So I can float alone again.
